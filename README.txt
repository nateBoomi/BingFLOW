It's BingFLOW!

-Import BingFLOW.package into your Flow tenant
-Use the BingFLOW player to run the flow
  -Custom components and css are both included directly in this player

-The encode/decode functionality is hosted on atomsphere using a Map element.  This is necessary as either is at risk for hitting the 1000 execution limit Flow has.
